This is a convertion of the original Fortran code for ELP82b used
to compute the Moon's position.

To call the function:
ELP82B(jd)

Where JD is the Julian Day in the TDB time scale.

Output will be the geocentric X,Y,Z coordinates in the J2000
reference frame in kilometers.

You will also need to include either elpdata-min.js or elpdata.js.
